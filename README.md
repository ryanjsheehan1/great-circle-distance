# Haversine forumla

The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points
on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation,
it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry,
the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles. [More info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

The Haversine.java class demonstrates a calculation of the great-circle distance when given a pair of longitude and latitudes.
